# UDPServer
Chat Server for UDP Communication

UDP Clients logged in a list and incomming messages go out to all Clients in this list.

In normal a UDP Connection sends and receives Data but don't have a stable connection to another socket.
To change this you can coding a server which manage the clients and do the task which UDP don't do for you.
